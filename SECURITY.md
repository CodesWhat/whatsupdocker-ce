## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in drydock, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email **<security@codeswhat.com>** or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/CodesWhat/drydock/security/advisories/new).

You can expect:

- **Acknowledgement** within 48 hours
- **Status update** within 7 days
- **Fix or mitigation** as soon as feasible, depending on severity

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
