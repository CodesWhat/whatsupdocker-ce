# Drydock Documentation

The published documentation is available at **[drydock.codeswhat.com/docs](https://drydock.codeswhat.com/docs)**.

## Local editing

The `content/` and `assets/` directories in this folder contain the MDX source files and images for the docs. They are gitignored and should be manually copied to the [drydock-website](https://github.com/codeswhat/drydock-website) repo when a new version is ready to publish.
